    <h2 id="sec1">Literature in education</h2>
    <p>For the majority of people around the world, our first serious encounter with literature comes from 
        school. Reading and writing has been drilled in all of us from an early age and this is set in motion
         with the start of examinations.</p>
<p>
        Being able to empathise with a group of characters written on a page is categorical and from a 
        student’s perspective a necessary skill.  Additionally, the ability to sense themes and messages 
        opens us up to another way of thinking. Literature becomes a vessel. The 130 million books which
         have been published around the world are guides for the reader and generate a bridge for them to 
         learn something new.</p>
         <h2 id="sec2">Literature within history</h2>
         <p>History is not only a gateway to the past, it’s also 
            suggestive of our present and the future. Within every time period lies different people and within them, 
            different stages in our ever-growing culture. Each individual before was a product of their own time. As a species we evolve every day 
            and without that timestamp that literature gives us, we would know nothing about the past.</p>
<P>Literature allows a person to step back in time and learn about life on Earth from the ones who walked before us. We can gather a better understanding of culture and have a greater appreciation of them. 
    We learn through the ways history is recorded, in the forms of manuscripts and through speech itself. </P>
<p>In periods from ancient Egypt, we can gather their history through hieroglyphics and paintings. The symbols Egyptians left behind are what we now use to understand their culture. This is different to Greek and Roman culture,
     which is found with greater ease, because of their innate desire for accuracy in their writing.</p>
     <p>This is the power that words have. They have the ability to spark a meaning, reform a nation and 
        create movements while being completely eternal. Inevitably, they will outlive their speaker.</p>

<h2 id="sec3">The impact of literature</h2>
<p>The impact of literature in modern society is undeniable. Literature acts as a form of expression for each individual author. 
    Some books mirror society and allow us to better understand the world we live in.  </p>
    <p>Authors like F.Scott Fitzgerald are prime examples of this as his novel The Great Gatsby was 
        a reflection of his experiences and opinions of America during the 1920s.</p>
        <p>We are easily connected to the psyche of authors through their stories. However, literature also reiterates the need to understand modern day issues like human conflict.</p>
