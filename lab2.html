        <section><h3>Pyramids of Giza</h3>
        <p>The Giza pyramid complex in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the 
            Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. 
            All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between c. 
            2600 – c. 2500 BC.</p>

            <section><h3>Best things to do at Pyramids of Giza</h3>
            <p>Without a doubt, the best thing to do while on the Giza Plateau is to see the three massive pyramids that dominate the landscape.

                To fully appreciate their enormity, get up close to the Great Pyramid. The limestone blocks are massive. Just imagine the manpower it took to build something like this. 
                It’s even more amazing to think that people built these pyramids almost 5,000 years ago.</p>
